******************************************
CHANGELOG: 1-11-2011
1) Added changelog file
2) removed -speaker versions from repo
3) removed -speaker compile options from the domake script

CHANGELOG: 02-11-2011
1) adding new script called 'er9x-builder.sh' to root folder.
   script cleans up the compile process of all the versions
   and should be easier to extend in the future.
   all 'compile' output ends up in the buildlog folder
   and is only shown if the compile failed.
